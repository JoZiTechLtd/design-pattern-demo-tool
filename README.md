# design-pattern-demo-tool
Rough tool exploring design patterns in Java. An old bit of student work (from a few years ago) to try and understand design patterns further.

Figured it may be helpful to others - but comes with a health warning of some filthy code and is most probably in desperate need of updates and refactoring to perhaps be useful.
